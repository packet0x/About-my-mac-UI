# macOS "About This Mac" - But It's a Website! ðŸ¤ª

Ever wanted to brag about your *fake* Mac specs without actually buying one?  Well, now you can!  This is a super serious, highly accurate (not really) recreation of the macOS "About This Mac" window... as a website.

## Get Your Own (Fake) Mac

1.  **Fork it!** (Click that "Fork" button at the top right. You know you want to.)
2.  **Clone it!** (`git clone [your-forked-repo-url]`)
3.  **Open `index.html`** in your browser. Boom! Instant (pretend) Macintosh.
4.  **Customize it?** Go wild! Change the specs, add features, make it even *more* ridiculous.  (But seriously, it's just HTML and CSS.)
5.  **Show it off!** Deploy it to GitHub Pages (or anywhere else) and fool your friends.

## Note

I SET THE WRONG IMAGE SO YOUR FOOL CAN BE DEFECTIVE EASILY LOLOLOL

## License

[MIT License](LICENSE) (Because sharing is caring, even fake Mac info.)  But, like, don't try to sell this as a real operating system.  Apple might get a *little* upset. ðŸ˜‰
